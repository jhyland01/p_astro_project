## Basic Usage

More detailed notes are in `long_notes.ipynb`.

We want to run the following from the command line (unix):
* Download the GWTC-3 population data by running `bash download_data.sh`.
* Create the igwn environment by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
* Install the P_astro_project by navigating to the root of the P_astro directory and running `pip3 install -e .` -e means development package so you can make changes.
* Select a set of hyperposteriors, these are the parameters which describe the population models. 
This is achieved with the `select_hyper` function in `select_hyperposterior.py` and defining how many sets of hyperparameters you want to select. 
This is run automatically within the `gibbs_sample.py` script which allows you to define the number of hyperparameters sets as an input arguement `nsets`.
* Sample from these sets of hyperposteriors to obtain posterior samples (mass, spin, redshift).
There is a dependency $m_1 > m_2$ and we sample mass and mass ratio so the values the mass ratio can take are dependent on what $m_1$ has been sampled as, we therefore use Gibbs sampling to account for this interdependence.
For each set of hyperposteriors, 1000 posterior samples are obtained, this can be changed withing the `gibbs_sample.py` script if necessary.
As an example, run `python3 gibbs_sample.py 30` to Gibbs sample from 30 sets of hyperposteriors.
The output will be saved as `params_for_SNR.csv` in the ouputs folder.
* Next we need to generate some signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and some false alarm rates (FARs).
To do this we run the `generate_SNRs_FARs.py` script which uses `bilby`.
This reads in the `params_for_SNR.csv` and uses the posterior samples to generate waveforms.
It currently uses the `IMRPhenomPv2` waveform approximant, this can be updated.
The FARs are approximated using a parameterisation presented in the Lynch et. al. paper.
This will output the `params_inc_FAR.csv` file.
* Following this we calculate the true alarm rates (TARs) and $P_\text{astro}$, underway as the `event_rate.ipynb` file.

Aside:
* The `create_database.py` script turns the `params_inc_FAR.csv` for searching/manipulating as an SQLite3 database if you are so inclined.
